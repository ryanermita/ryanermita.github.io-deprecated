Hi! I'm Ryan. I find joy in engineering softwares; the excitement, frustrations, and its complexity. I currently work at Uploan Philippines as a Lead Software Engineer. Here, I'll share my learnings and thoughts in regards of software engineering.

In my free time, I do volunteer work. Before I was one of the Mozilla Representatives in the Philippines, where I focused on the web literacy initiatives of Mozilla; I facilitate workshops, organize events, and do tech talks in universities and other tech community events. Currently I'm volunteering at Python Philippines, where I focused on Python training initiatives.
