Bad weather and great distance is not a hinder for [Mozilla Philippines Community](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) to have our Campus Tour at Quezon City Polytechnic University (QCPU) dated last September 14. Thanks to Mr. Christian Kenneth Mariano our FSA in QCPU for making the event possible.

We received a lot of questions from the QCPU students and itâ€™s great! Their questions prove that our talks lights up their interest about Mozilla Community and its projects. We hope to see them again on the next Mozilla events.
