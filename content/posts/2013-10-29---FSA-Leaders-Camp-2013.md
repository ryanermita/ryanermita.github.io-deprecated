[Firefox Student Ambassadors (FSA)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors%E2%80%8E) are college students who share the same passion in [Mozilla’s mission](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/) in building a better internet. They are one of the most important contributors of Mozilla, by inspiring and educating students like them and even adults that they can make the web a better place for the benefit of all web users. They are the next generation leaders and Web innovators.

So, to help these FSA to enhance their leadership skills and boost their knowledge about [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and its [projects](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/), [Mozilla Philippines Community](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) organized the first ever FSA Leaders Camp. It was a two days training program attended by FSA Leaders from different schools and mostly all the [Mozilla Reps (ReMos)](https://reps.mozilla.org/%E2%80%8E) in the Philippines.

On our first day, I and other ReMos gave a talk to FSA leaders about Mozilla and its projects, such as [Mozilla Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Webmaker](https://webmaker.org/), [WoMoz])(http://womoz.org/), [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), and Firefox OS. We also discussed some open source software used by Mozilla, like [BugZilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/), for enhancing its projects . This makes them more knowledgeable about Mozilla, so, when they became a speaker or attend conferences, they can share a lot of information to their listeners.

While on our second day, aside from enhancing their skills in public speaking, we set a lot of activities that strengthened the bond between the FSA from different schools. Furthermore, those activities improved their leadership skills and cooperation with their members.

Those two days was full of learning and fun for both FSA and ReMo’s. We are very glad that we have these talented student leaders who are passionate to make a difference, and soon, these students will change the way we live online.
