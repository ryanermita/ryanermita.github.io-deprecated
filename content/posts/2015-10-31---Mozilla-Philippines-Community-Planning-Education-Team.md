Last October 24 and 25, [Mozilla Philippines Community](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) had an awesome Strategic Planning facilitated by program manager of [Mozilla Reps](https://reps.mozilla.org/) program and Mozilla Reps council member [Rosana Ardila](https://reps.mozilla.org/u/rardila/). We had a fun and very informative sessions. We discussed things like: Things that are valued by the community members, conflict resolution points, community and volunteers growth, and plans of each functional areas in the next few months. In this post I will share the plans of Mozilla Philippines Education Team in the next 6 months.

To make sure we are on the right track, we use test cards in our planning session. After listing the things we want to do in the Education Team, we came up to focus on these three areas: Local Curriculum, Marketing, and partnerships. Here are the test cards:

### Mozilla Community Education Team Local Curriculum
__Hypothesis__: We believe that making a Mozilla learning curriculum customized for the Philippine setting will make it easy for locals to learn and teach Web; and make locals care about their online lives.

__Test__: To verify that:
- We will create a local curriculum with the help of professionals consisting of the ff:
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for beginners, intermediate, and advanced level.
  - Security and Privacy.
- Have an archive of local curriculum and courses for each level:
  - beginner
  - intermediate
  - ninja

__Metric__: And measure the # of makes and evaluate the curriculum through surveys/ questionnaires/ feedback.

__Criteria__: We are right if there are learners went on another level and we have an archive of effective curriculum in each level.

__Needs__: passionate web literacy mentors and partnerships with other educational related organization.

### Mozilla Community Education Team Marketing
__Hypothesis__: We believe that establishing online presence of Mozilla Learning Initiatives by posting or sharing on social media to reach out possible web literacy mentors.

__Test__: To verify that, we will try posting on some educational-related groups about the program.

__Metric__: And measure the responses, events, mentors and partners

__Criteria__: We are right if we can get more events partners, and mentors for the program.

__Needs__: Social media training of MozPH volunteers

### Mozilla Community Education Team Partnerships
__Hypothesis__: We believe that forming meaningful partnerships with relevant organizations will enable us to improve Web literacy in the Philippines by helping us reach untapped markets and have more resources

__Test__: To verify that we will connect with the Dept. of Education to propose an initiative that could help them with the implementation of grades 11 & 12 (i.e. tools, community support)

__Metric__: And measure the number of schools/ teachers who actually implemented compared to the number of schools/ teachers that we presented the tools to.

__Criteria__: We are right if the number of schools/ teachers who implemented it/ continued using it after an academic year is at least 90% of the population that we presented to.

__Needs__: Support from HQ (representative to talk to DepEd), training of MozPH volunteers talking to partners, funds (travel etc)
