Student developers are the new rising rock stars, and with this event happened last July 27 2013 by Mr. Aaron Cajes, aims to focus on knowledge sharing about Firefox OS development for students around University Belt in Manila. In this event, students learned the basics of Firefox OS; it’s truly open mobile ecosystem and a hands-on experience with Firefox OS developer preview device.

The program was formally started by Mr. [Kemuel Domanog](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/mozcoffee-firefox-os-for-students/kjdomanog.com), a [Mozilla Philippines Representative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo%E2%80%8E), he explained what Mozilla is and how it start her in the Philippines, its mission and current projects like [Webmaker](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/mozcoffee-firefox-os-for-students/webmaker.org) and [Womoz](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/08/25/mozcoffee-firefox-os-for-students/womoz.org).

The main topic for this event was handled by Mr. Aaron Cajes, a Mozilla Philippines Representative and a Mobile Application Developer. He discussed the Firefox OS and its basics, as well as how simple it is to develop their own app by just HTML5, CSS and Javascript. He also let the attendees to use his Geeksphone Keon for them to experience a device empowered by Firefox OS.

The event became more interesting as Mr. Cajes grouped the students by their school to have a brainstorming on what App they are interested to work on. The students App ideas are: MeBo by FSA’s of University of Sto. Tomas, Where u @ by FSA’s of Adamson University, TrackMe by FSA’s of UE Manila and Bulacan State University, and the CODIGO by the FSA’s of FEU Manila. I won’t explain more about their apps, I want it to be a surprise to you guys, so let’s just wait until they turn these ideas into reality. Goodluck FSA’s, we’re pretty excited on your Apps!
