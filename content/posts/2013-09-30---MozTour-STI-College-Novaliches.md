[STI](http://www.sti.edu/) is one of the best computer schools in the Philippines. Though its area of expertise is technology related, they also offer other programs such as: Business and Management, Engineering, and a lot more. Thanks to our [Firefox Student Ambassadors (FSA)](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/universityambassadors/) in STI Novaliches for organizing the Campus tour last September 28, in that way, [Mozilla Philippines Community](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/moztour-sti-college-novaliches/www.mozillaphilippines.org/%E2%80%8E)  share insights about the Open Web, Mozilla products, Firefox OS in their campus.  So far, STI Novaliches is the biggest STI campus I’ve encountered and has the largest number of audience that I talked to.

The Mozilla Philippines representatives and volunteers present in the event are Mr. [Joell lapitan](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/moztour-sti-college-novaliches/jlapitan.com), Mr. [Kemuel Domonog](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/moztour-sti-college-novaliches/kjdomanog.com), Mr. [Robert Reyes](http://www.bobreyes.com/blog/), Mr. [Aaron Cajes](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/moztour-sti-college-novaliches/aaroncajes.com), Ms. [Danica Santos](https://twitter.com/doneDANhere), Mr.[Arjay Oboza](https://twitter.com/YeyArjay) and me. We gave talks about the latest and different projects of Mozilla. In each talk, STI students became aware of what Mozilla is and the opportunities it gives regardless if they are still students, professionals, or web users. We are hoping to meet them again in other Mozilla events or have a campus tour in other STI campuses.
