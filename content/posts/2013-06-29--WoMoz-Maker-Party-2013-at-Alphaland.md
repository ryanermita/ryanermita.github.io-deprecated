While the WebMaker Party is an event which goal is to turn web users into webmakers, giving the users the ideas and better understanding on how the web works, that can help them to easily create things on the web. This project has two tools: the Thimble which goal is to teach basic HTML and CSS, and the Popcorn maker which gives the users an ease of use in creating/editing videos and the likes where the web is the platform. This Webmaker Party also gives the attendees the ideas on how can they teach on the web, to share their knowledge and ideas that can be helpful for the beginners and gives an additional knowledge for the other non-beginners.

On the event, after the MozillaPH Representatives discussed the overview of Mozilla and its projects; especially Webmaker and WoMoz. The attendees grouped themselves into 2 – 3 persons as they start making things on the web by using Thimble and Popcorn maker. The Maker Party at Alphaland is somehow like a mini-hackaton where the attendees competed while having fun on creating web content using Webmaker tools, where the goal is to promote WoMoz(Women and Mozilla). At the end of the event, attendees show their masterpiece, as the MozillaPH Representatives that are also present in the event judged their works. Congrats to the winners.
