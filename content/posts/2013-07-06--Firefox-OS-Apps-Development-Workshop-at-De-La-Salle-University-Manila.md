Firefox OS (sometimes abbreviated FxOS) is a new mobile operating system developed by Mozilla. It uses a Linux kernel and boots into a Gecko-based runtime engine, which lets users run applications, developed entirely using HTML, Javascript, and other open web application APIs. – [Developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS)

Mr. Bob Reyes, a [Mozilla Philippines Representative](https://reps.mozilla.org/), start the workshop by sharing to the La Salle students the Mozilla and its Philippine Community, as well as its mission and projects that will benefit  the internet and mobile users regardless their jobs, age, gender, etc.

After the students finished their webpages, Mr. Aaron Cajes, a Mozilla Philippines Representative and a Mobile App developer, guide these students on how can they make their web pages into web app. In his talked he explained the Firefox OS Simulator, so even though the students didn’t have a device, they can test their Firefox OS app by just using the Firefox browser. Mr. Cajes Also explained the importance of the [Web app Manifest file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Manifest), which is the most important file in web app development.

We also gave our best in answering some of their queries regarding to Mozilla and Firefox OS.
