The highlight of the opening remarks was the PyCon Code of Conduct. This code of conduct aims for the attendees, organizer, sponsors, and volunteer to have an enjoyable and fulfilling PyCon experience. Below is the quoted short version of the PyCon PH Code of Conduct. You can also find the long version of this CoC at the [PyCon PH 2018 website](https://pycon.python.ph/).

> *PyCon PH is a community conference intended for collaboration in the developer community.
 We value the participation of each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by Python.PH or not.
 To make clear what is expected, all delegates/attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers and volunteers at any PyCon event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. - pycon.python.ph*

## PyCon PH 2018 Day 1

### Why Python in Scientific Research?
Speaker: Erika Fille Legara Ph.D., Program Director, Master of Science in Data Science, Asian Institute of Management
- You can just write your long c++ code in just 2 lines using python.
- You can get the results of your computations in minutes rather than hours.
- There are many available packages or libraries for data computation.
- The community. Package/library authors are reachable!
- Python is a dynamically typed language. less worry about declaring variable’s data type.
- Easy to learn and understand so it can easily use for prototyping.

here’s the [link](https://speakerdeck.com/eflegara/why-python-in-scientific-research) of her slide deck, [twitter](https://twitter.com/eflegara) and [github](https://github.com/eflegara).

### Introduction to the Natural Language Processing with Python
Speaker: Albertus Kelvin, A student majoring in Computer Science, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB)

I’m interested on this talk but sadly the speaker wasn’t available

### Python and the Blockchain Revolution

Speaker: Johnny Estilles, Engineering Manager, Freelancer.com

I’m interested on this talk but sadly the speaker wasn’t available

### Introduction to Python

Speaker: Sony Valdez, Trustee, PythonPH

These are the basic python things that I didn’t know before this talk.

- multi line string
```
long_string = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat."""
```

- end of life of python 2 will be on 2020 — check countdown [here](https://pythonclock.org/).
- validate your package or library if it supports python 3 — check it [here](https://python3wos.appspot.com/).
- String repetition
```
int * string # will repeat string depends on the int value
10 * ryan # will repeat ryan 10 times.
```

- you can use help() on your python console to know more about the python modules.
```
import json
help(json) # will show more details and example using this module
```

### Hello, Community

Speaker: Al Sweigart, Author of several Python books including Automate the Boring Stuff, InventWithPython.com

This is one of my favorite keynote.

- “programming is something I capable of doing.” — Al Sweigart
- The point of pycon is to meet people, here’s his tips on how to meet new people in PyCon (works as well with other conferences)
- Stand like pacman. Most of the time group of people in conferences talks in circle, so why not leave a little space on your group so people can easily join your circle.
- Skip talks, again the point of pycon is to meet people.
- Dont eat alone. Eat together with your new-found friends or with other attendees and discuss things.
- Skip friends. Time to meet new people, you can catch up with your friends at the end of the event.
- Print business cards. There should be a way to the people you’ve met to have a way to contact you after the event.
- Follow up! Contact the people you’ve met after the event.
- Shirt color trick — an easy way to met new people.
- Think of a color
- Find the closest person wearing that color.
- Talk to that person
- Instant friend!

### Healthy Python: Applying Python in Healthcare

Speaker: Niño Eclarin, Hacarus, Software Engineer

Here he introduce the tech problems in healthcare innovation. He gives some tools they’re using in Hacarus in solving those problems.

Problems need to solve.
- Data delivery
- Data security and data integrity
- custom tracking and monitoring
- accessible diagnosis

Packages/Library and tools that they use to solve their tech problems
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - a mircro framework so it is good for prototyping and it can scale!
- [sqlalchemy](http://sqlalchemy-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - reliable orm.
- [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) — good for deployment automation and other tasks.
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) — a container tool, makes deployement easy.
- [boto](https://github.com/boto/boto) — library interface for AWS
- [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) — for data presentation (worth checking out, most of the lightning talks use jupyter in their presentation)
- [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)- a machine learning library
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) — for data analysis
- [plotly](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) — visualization library
- Functional is way faster than object oriented.
- [itsdangerous](http://pythonhosted.org/itsdangerous/) library for data encryption

here’s the [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xllPf7TXiddFoTsbJh0EKgmKprRaGj8-D7hpg04930g/edit#slide=id.p) of his slide deck and [github](https://github.com/pprmint).

### Write Clean and Maintainable Code with Service Objects

Speaker: Mitchel Cabuloy, Design Director, Kirigami

[Use Django Service Objects](https://github.com/mixxorz/django-service-objects) to separate your business logic

advantages:
- decoupled from model and view logic
- can be easily tested and maitain
- can be easily reuse.
- can chain Service objects call.

here’s the [link](https://mitchel.me/2017/django-service-objects/) of his article about service object, [twitter](https://twitter.com/mixxorz) and [github](https://github.com/mixxorz)

### Designing Reliable, Scalable & Secure Data-Intensive Python Apps
Speaker: Joshua Arvin Lat, Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Complete Business Online

Interested in this talk, but I’m already drained to take notes so lets wait for the PyConPH to upload the video of this talk.

## PyCon PH 2018 Day 2

### Processing the Social Web
Speaker: Jezeniel Zapanta, Software Engineer, LenddoEFL
This workshop focused on using Celery and flask crash course

[Celery](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/patterns/celery/)
- a tool for async tasks and jobs.
- can be easily set up
- can chain tasks/jobs
- use redis or rabbitMQ for queuing jobs/tasks
- can run multiple workers
- can be use for periodic tasks.

here’s the [link](http://slides.com/jezenielzapanta/processing-the-social-web#/) of his slide deck about Processing the Social Web, [twitter](https://twitter.com/jezeniel) and [github](https://github.com/jezeniel)



### Lightning talks highlights
- 32 mini games developed in just one weekend using pygame
- a 9 year old kid present how he’s using python in minecraft
- a project that can read hand symbols using opencv. Discuss a lot of usage of opencv.
- Most of the lightning talks uses jupyter.

*Thats all my notes. will be waiting for the uploaded videos of the talks that I missed or missed to note.*

## Conclusion
Python is a very useful tool, can be use in web development, game development, data science, machine learning, and even for fun. In this PyCon, people showcase their projects and the python libraries they use to solve their tech problems. It’s very apparent that we don’t need to reinvent the wheel, a lot of libraries and packages are all around the web and are ready for us to use. These libraries are flexible enough to address our problems and most of them are open source which means we have the freedom to add new features and optimize them.

Python developer around the web are always ready to help and having a reachable library authors saves developers a lot of time debugging codes and even learn whats the idea and rationale of those libraries. Knowing the rationale behind these libraries is a great help for the developers to decide what library or package to use. This programming language is much more powerful because of its community.
