On the last part of this event, I, also a FSA of Letran Calamba until I graduated and now an active volunteer of Mozilla, shared the Webmaker project of Mozilla to the new FSAs of Letran Calamba; my talked covered the mission of the Webmaker project, which is to turn web users into web makers by using Webmaker tools: [Thimble and Popcorn maker](https://webmaker.org/tools). I also talked about the [badges](https://badges.webmaker.org/) they can get as acknowledgement as their skills level up by using these tools. In addition to that, I told them about the [Mentor or the Teach](https://webmaker.org/en-US/teach) part of the Webmaker project where they can get help and guidance in learning web basics, and how they can be one of the mentors by sharing their knowledge to the  other Webmaker project users. Lastly, I shared to them, what are the types of [maker party](https://webmaker.org/en-US/event-guides) and how can they organized their own one.
