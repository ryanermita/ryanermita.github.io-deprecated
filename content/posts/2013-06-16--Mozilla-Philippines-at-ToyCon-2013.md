Oooops. but what MozillaPH doing in such event? Our mission is to promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the Web, not only for the web developers, web designers and the likes but for everyone especially the web users. It’s so cool that there’s a lot of Firefox users in this event and we received a lot of sign ups in our booth, as they are signing up or while they are waiting on the line we introduced them who Mozilla is, what are we doing and how can they [contribute](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/) in our mission. To make the event more awesome for Firefox users and some developers who signed up in our booth, we raffled a Firefox T-shirt  .There are also a lot of student who visit our booth. We introduce to them the [FSA or the Firefox Student Ambassador](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/universityambassadors/) and how can they contribute to make a better future on the web. The advantage of being one of us and how can it affect their future specially if they love technologies and the web.

For the developers who visited our booth, we gave them a chance to experience to use the [Firefox geeksphone keon](http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/geeksphone-keon/4505-6452_7-35619072.html), empowered by [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/partners/) we discussed to them how that OS developed, how can they easily developed their own web application and how can they market it on [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/).
