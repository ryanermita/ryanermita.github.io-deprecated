This event happened last August 17, 2013 at Coffee Bean Tea Leaf, Two E-com Tower near Mall of Asia, the goal of this event is to orient the attendees about the WoMoz project and Mozilla itself. Planning about incoming WoMoz events was also part of the agenda of this event.

The event commence as Ms. [Faye Tandog](http://fayetandog.wordpress.com/), a [Mozilla Philippines Representative](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo), properly introduced Mozilla and its goal to the attendees. She also orients them about the Mozilla projects like [Firefox Student Ambassador (FSA)](https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors), [Webmaker](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/womoz-phl-team-meet-up/webmaker.org) and [WoMoz](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/07/womoz-phl-team-meet-up/womoz.org). On the middle of the event, one attendee asked about the Firefox Flicks in Cinemalaya, and it was answered well by Mozilla Philippines Community Manager Mr. [Eusebio Barrun](http://www.ebarrun.com/). Furthermore, Ms. Faye Tandog gave me a chance to provide the overview of [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) to the attendees.
