Hooray! A great start of the year 2014 for [Mozilla Philippines Community](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/), as the Firefox OS app development workshop, the first event of the year (also my first event as a Mozilla Rep haha), successfully delivered last January 11, 2014 at STI – Novaliches. It was not the first time of the Mozilla Philippines at [STI – Novaliches](http://www.stinovaliches.net/) as we’ve been there last year for the [Mozilla Campus Tour](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/30/moztour-sti-college-novaliches/), and after that the school request a workshop for their students related to [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/), that request proved that we successfully enlighten them about [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), that they want to explore more about the [Mozilla projects](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/products/).

The Mozilla Philippines team for this workshop composes of four Mozilla Reps: Ryan Ermita (me), [Aaron Cajes](http://www.aaroncajes.com/), [Chor Compendio](https://www.facebook.com/mcompendio?fref=ts), and my mentor [Robert Reyes](http://www.bobreyes.com/myblog/). We also have 5 [Firefox Student Ambassador (FSA)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/universityambassadors/) from different schools in our team: [Arjay Oboza](https://twitter.com/YeyArjay), [Kristian Lugtu](https://twitter.com/KristianLugtu), [Sheila Revilla](https://twitter.com/aliehslool), [Joshua Rubin](https://twitter.com/osh03) and [Gio Legasto](https://twitter.com/gioooow). Every one of us gave our best to guide the students as the workshop goes on.

This workshop helps to broaden the knowledge and opportunity of the students and even professionals in their career as an IT. They know HTML, CSS, and Javascript; and build websites using those technologies, well in this workshop we show them that with their existing knowledge and tools, they can even build mobile apps. Oh yes! Mobile Apps developed using the core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The workshop starts by briefing the students about the Firefox OS and the technologies behind it. Aaron Cajes, one of the Mozilla Representative in the Philippines, gave the talk about Firefox OS that, he also show the students how simple it is to build an app using HTM, CSS, and Javascript.  In addition to that, he introduced the [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/) where the students can submit and showcase their apps.

After the discussion of Firefox OS, Kristian Lugtu, one of the awesome FSA in the Philippines, teach the students how to build media queries for responsive design and discuss the importance of it. He also gave the students a sample template they can play with, so they can personally experience how to work with media queries.

The next part of the workshop is a mini hackaton. We gave them time (an hour and a half) to build their own simple app using their existing projects or even make it from scratch. As they build their apps we are roaming around the room to guide some students on the problems they encountered while they are developing their app.

After the time given for the mini hackaton, I and other Mozilla Reps here in the Philippines assess all the works of the students and gave special awards to those who have awesome Apps.
