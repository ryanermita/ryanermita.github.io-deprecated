Software expo is one of the coolest event of School of Computer Studies and Technology, one of the school department at [Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba](http://letran-calamba.edu.ph/) (my Alma mater), its goal is to empower their students on the latest trend of technology through seminars and to showcase the talents of their students by means of exhibits. Some student put on display their robots with awesome functionality; while the other shows the systems they developed that will give its users a convenient way in doing their tasks.

This year software expo’s theme is about “Mobile Technology Shift for Borderless Opportunities”. So, with the help of our [FSA in Letran Calamba](https://twitter.com/LetranCALFSA), we had given a chance to showcase the [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) and the [Mozilla Webmaker](https://webmaker.org/). Students who visited our booth were amaze on the Firefox OS when we told them that it was only developed using core web technologies like CSS, HTML5, and Javascript. We also explain to them on how they can easily develop their own app with just the tools that are already available to them.

With the students that don’t have yet the basic knowledge about web technologies like HTML and CSS, we introduced to them the Mozilla Webmaker, and we see that they had fun in remaking some starter makes.
