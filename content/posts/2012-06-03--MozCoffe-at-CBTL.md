I had a great day! Thanks to [Mozilla Philippines representatives](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo%E2%80%8E) that invite us to have a cup of coffee and some pastries with them at Coffee Bean Teal Leaf near SM Mall of Asia.

While having a cup of coffee Mozilla representative Mr. [Eusebio Barrun](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/mozcoffe-cbtl/www.ebarrun.com/%E2%80%8E) and Mr. [Bob Reyes](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2012/06/03/mozcoffe-cbtl/www.bobreyes.com/%E2%80%8E) explained to us what the organization does: to represent Mozilla in our country, promote the Mozilla projects and its mission and to recruit and support new Mozilla contributors. What its mission, and what benefits we can get from being Mozilla Student Representative, even though Mozilla is a non-profit organization.

As i remember, some of the benefits we can get as a Mozilla representative (aside from having a free pen, stickers, baller, pins and ID lace  :P) are : It will train us to organize events and to speak in front of large audience, It will give us a network of professionals, that can help us in our future projects, It will give us the chance to meet new friends with the same interest, and It will help us to enhance our skills and knowledge that we can use in out chosen track.

In that meeting also, it gives me a chance to ask some questions about web and web development. I learned a lot from that meeting, and I’m hoping that I can attend future meetings or events that are part of Mozilla. At the end of the day there are many things i want to learn that are related to web development. And I’m inspired to explore and learn new things. Thanks Mozilla Philippines Representatives!
