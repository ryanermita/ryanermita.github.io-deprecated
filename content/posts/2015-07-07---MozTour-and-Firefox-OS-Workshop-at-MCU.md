It was a successful whole day event for [Mozilla Philippines Community](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) at Manila Central University! The first part of the event was the MozTour. Here we discussed the overview of [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Firefox Student Ambassador](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/studentambassadors/), and the overview of [Mozilla Learning](https://teach.mozilla.org/). The topics was discussed by [Faye Tandog](https://twitter.com/fayetandog), [Joshua Rubin](https://twitter.com/oshrubin), and [Ryan Ermita](https://twitter.com/ryanermita), respectively.

I facilitated the second part of the event which is the [Firefox OS](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/2.0/) workshop. After discussing the overview of the mobile OS and did some demonstration on how to create a Firefox OS app, we let the attendees to experiment and create their own app. It was a fun and full of learning activity. The awesome part is some of the attendees are just starting to learn the core web technologies(HTML, CSS, and Javascript) and they did create their own app in just a matter of at least two hours!
