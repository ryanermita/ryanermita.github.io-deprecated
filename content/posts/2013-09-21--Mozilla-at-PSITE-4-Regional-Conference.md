Given that all of the speakers effectively share their ideas and experienced to the students, I’m sure those students got a bunch of information on the latest trend about the most used gadget and technology in our generation today – The Mobile Technology."

[Philippine Society of Information Technology Educators (PSITE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Society_of_Information_Technology_Educators) Region 4 conducted a regional conference about “Global Preparedness for the Mobile Technology Solutions” at Colegio de San Juan de Letran Calamba (my alma mater) last September 2, it was attended by a lot of students in different schools in the region. Given that all of the speakers effectively share their ideas and experienced to the students, I’m sure those students got a bunch of information on the latest trend about the most used gadget and technology in our generation today – The Mobile Technology.

It was a whole day conference. So, to make the attendees stay active – a lot of students representing their schools show their talents, such as dancing and singing, which is indeed entertaining!

Since, the conference is about Mobile Technology, [Mozilla Philippines](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) take a part of this conference by showing to the students around region 4 the “[Firefox OS](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/mozilla-at-psite-4-regional-conference/www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/%E2%80%8E)“. On our booth, we give them a chance to explore the Firefox mobile OS and we also answer their questions all about Mozilla and its projects.

After the talks of Mr. [Joell Lapitan](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/mozilla-at-psite-4-regional-conference/jlapitan.com) about Firefox OS and Mr. [Kemuel Domanog](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/mozilla-at-psite-4-regional-conference/kjdomanog.com) on [Firefox Student Ambassador](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/universityambassadors/%E2%80%8E), the number of students visit our booth quickly increased to check the Firefox mobile OS personally and to clarify some things about it. While, some of the students came to our booth to learn more about the the Firefox Student Ambassador and other Mozilla projects.
