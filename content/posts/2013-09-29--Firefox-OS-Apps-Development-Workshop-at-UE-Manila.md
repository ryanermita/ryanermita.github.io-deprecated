Mr. Aaron, Mr. Kemuel and Mr. Lugtu had their talks about Firefox OS and Firefox Student Ambassador. While me and Mr. Ang, assists the students in the app development. Itâ€™s an awesome experience to help others by sharing our knowledge and showing them that there are many opportunities for them in the web using the tools that are already available to them.

After some talks and demonstration, we gave the students enough time to create their simple but awesome app. While some students are smoothly working on their apps, we help/assists the other students on the problems they encounter in app development. And in the end of the day most of them successfully create their Awesome App!
