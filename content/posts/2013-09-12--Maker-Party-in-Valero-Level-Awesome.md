[Mozilla Philippines](http://www.mozillaphilippines.org/) organized a lot of Maker party in the past months – and have a lot of incoming maker party too. But this last September 6 Maker Party was out of the ordinary. Why? Because we had a special guests – Mr. [Mark Surman](http://commonspace.wordpress.com/about/), Executive Director of Mozilla Foundation, came to the Philippines to witness our maker party happened in Valero Makati. He witnesses the skills and extraordinary ideas of Pilipino’s in creating web contents through the use of Webmaker tools; as well as P[rima Yogi Loviniltra](http://loviniltra.com/), a [Mozilla Representative](https://reps.mozilla.org/) from Indonesia was present in this event. In addition to what our attedees learned in our maker party – specially creating cool stuffs using Webmaker tools, they personally met and had a little chitchat with our guests (Cool! isnt it?). Furthermore, lucky winner of the best Make(web content) of the event won not only a Webmaker T-shirt but also will received a cash prize.

So, after an awesome Maker Party, we had a dinner with Mr. Mark Surman (he is really a cool guy!). Since, he and Prima is our valuable guests, we surprised them with some Pilipino food such as [“Balut”](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/maker-party-in-valero-level-awesome/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balut_(egg)%E2%80%8E) and [“Polvoron“](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/maker-party-in-valero-level-awesome/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polvor%C3%B3n%E2%80%8E), we are happy that they like it. We hope to meet them again in another Mozilla event.
