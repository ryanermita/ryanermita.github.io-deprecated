[Youth Congress on Information Technology](http://y4it.org/) is a 3 day (September 17-19) event aims to empower Information Technology students and the likes in their chosen career. This event was attended by thousands of students around the Philippines. Speakers of this event are indeed in different level, they effectively share their knowledge and experienced to the students. Some of those speakers are from [Freelancer.com](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/24/mozilla-at-11th-philippine-youth-congress-on-information-technology/www.freelancer.com/),  [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/), [Linux Professional Institute](http://www.lpi.org/), and [Mozilla Philippines](http://mozillaphilippines.org/).

Mr. [Eusebio Barrun](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/24/mozilla-at-11th-philippine-youth-congress-on-information-technology/ebarrun.com), Community Manager of Mozilla Philippines had talked about Mozilla and its projects – and the reasons behind it. He also shares how Mozilla started in the Philippines. In addition, he also demonstrates some Firefox features like viewing websites in 3D, which is very helpful for both web developer and web designer. He also encourages all of the attendees to contribute on making the open web a better place for all of us (netizens).

We also had a booth on this event where Firefox users can join our raffle by just signing up on our database. The lucky winners won either a Firefox bag or Firefox T-shirt. It’s good to know that there are so many Firefox users on this event. Many of them are not only users but a developer, professors, and other professionals who wants to be part of Mozilla’s projects ([FSA](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/universityambassadors/%E2%80%8E) and [Firefox OS](https://ryanermita.wordpress.com/2013/09/24/mozilla-at-11th-philippine-youth-congress-on-information-technology/www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/%E2%80%8E)) in promoting open web.

Since our booth has a long line, I and other volunteers, especially FSA, discussed to people on the line the FSA program of Mozilla and we let them explore the Geeksphone Keon empowered by Firefox OS. All of them became interested on Mozilla, so, we told them on how they can contact us if they want Mozilla Philippines to visit their schools to have a broader discussion about Mozilla and its projects. This kind of activity benefits the FSA in a way that they enhance their communication skills and a having opportunity to socialized to other students and professionals around the Philippines.

After this event, we are expecting a loads of emails of schools requesting for a Mozilla  Campus Tour. I’m pretty excited about it! :)
