The first session started by giving the attendees some time to make some friends out of other attendees and MozillaPH representatives and volunteer. With that, aside from new knowledge at the end of the sessions, they gained new friends and some professional networks which can help them in near future. As the first session formally, which is the Git Basics, Mr. Kevin Ventura, a MozillaPH representative, introduced what Git is; explained commonly used terms/commands like: repository, commit, pull and push; the advantages of using Git is also part of the session specially for collaborative work.
