We can ensure that our code still works regardless of code changes if we’re doing tests. That’s why doing tests is very important part of building a well-designed application because it ensures quality. Aside from software quality this arcticle will discuss other reasons why writing tests on your software is necessary. Also, this article will have a walk-through on how to write unit tests in Python using unittest module.","category":"Software Engineering","title":"Unit Testing with Python unittest module"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Software Engineering","currentPage":1,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":4,"prevPagePath":"/category/software-engineering","nextPagePath":"/category/software-engineering/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3872291177","401334301"]}
