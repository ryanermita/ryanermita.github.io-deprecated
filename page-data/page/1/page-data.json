We can ensure that our code still works regardless of code changes if we’re doing tests. That’s why doing tests is very important part of building a well-designed application because it ensures quality. Aside from software quality this arcticle will discuss other reasons why writing tests on your software is necessary. Also, this article will have a walk-through on how to write unit tests in Python using unittest module."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":1,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":4,"prevPagePath":"/","nextPagePath":"/page/2","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":true}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3872291177","401334301"]}
