With me in our team are Mozilla Reps Tina Verbo, Faye Tandog, Kemuel Domanog, Aaron Cajes, Firefox Student Ambassador Marcus Ang, and new MozPH volunteers CK Luna, Red Prudente, Roger Duran, Mikko De Vera, and Jeff Soriano. This event is the first time that we have included Firefox OS in our Maker Party, which made it really challenging on our part but thanks to these volunteers who came with us, we managed to make the event a huge success."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"maker party","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/maker-party","nextPagePath":"/tag/maker-party/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3872291177","401334301"]}
