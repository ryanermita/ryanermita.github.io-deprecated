I stumble upon GatsbyJS, an open-source static website generator (SSG) that is based on the frontend development framework React and makes use of Webpack and GraphQL technology. It can be used to build static sites that are progressive web apps, follow the latest web standards, and optimized for speed and security. On this article I'll be sharing the steps and aha-moments during my exploring of GatsbyJS while creating my own blog site."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/fix-liquibase-duplicate-key-constaints","categorySlug":"/category/software-engineering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fix Liquibase Duplicate Key Constraints","date":"2020-04-21","category":"Software Engineering","description":"Got stuck on a problem during our deployment.
